# FAC-V: An FPGA-Based AES Coprocessor for RISC-V

## Overview

FAC-V is a project that demonstrates an FPGA-based AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) coprocessor designed for RISC-V processors. The project highlights how FPGA technology can be used to enhance the performance and security of IoT devices through hardware acceleration. This coprocessor can be implemented using both tightly and loosely coupled approaches, offering flexibility and significant performance improvements over software-only solutions.

## Features

- **Hardware-accelerated AES encryption**: Supports AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.
- **Tightly and loosely coupled implementations**: Compatible with RISC-V Rocket Core.
- **Low power consumption**: Designed for low-end IoT devices.
- **Easy integration**: User-friendly API for seamless integration with various IoT operating systems or baremetal applications.
